> "Of all search records, what percentage were clicked in the top 3 results — and what percentage weren't?"

---

### 🧠 Solution:

```sql
select
  (100.0 * count(case when clicked = 1 and search_results_position <= 3 then 1 end) / count(*)) as top_3_clicked,
  (100.0 * count(case when clicked = 0 and search_results_position <= 3 then 1 end) / count(*)) as top_3_notclicked
from fb_search_events;
```

---

### ✅ Result:

Two percentages in one row — giving you a snapshot of how users interact with top-ranked results.

---

### 🎯 Why this matters:

Click-through rate is one of the clearest signals of user engagement in search. This kind of metric helps us understand:

- Are top results delivering value?
- Are users skipping the first few results?
- How can we improve the ranking or relevance?

This can provide useful feedback for search algorithms, product teams, and UX designers.
