## 💻 SQL of the Day: How Easy Is Too Easy?

I worked on several easy SQL questions from StrataScratch recently. Here are the problems:

- https://lnkd.in/gDysHxpS
- https://lnkd.in/gM7UEkVd

Even if they have different problems, they share common themes:

- Aggregation (`count`, `sum`, `avg`)
- Filtering with `where`
- Time extraction
- Simple window functions
- Grouping logic

These queries look simple, but they show up everywhere in real work — counting users, ranking content, tracking trends, or finding the latest records.

### Why this matters:

If these fundamentals aren't solid, more complex SQL will always feel harder than it should. Easy SQL done well is about clear thinking and understanding the data, not complexity. Repetition builds speed, accuracy, and confidence.
